# SRT-to-DFXP
Converts SRT file(s) to a Netflix-readable DFXP file(s). I made this instead of using Subflicks so that you could convert a group of files instead of having to do one at a time.

It hasn't been tested on a large variety of SFX files. So I can't guarantee it will work flawlessly. From what has been tested, it seems to work.
